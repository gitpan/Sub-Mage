Revision history for Sub-Mage

I apologize for not updating this. From 0.14 I will try to remember :)

0.018   02/Dec/2011
        I doubt I will be updating Sub::Mage anymore, sorry. It has been taken over by Goose. It's basically Sub::Mage, but without the silly method names, and some 
        extra sugar for those with a sweet tooth ;-)
        There have been no changes in this release - it's merely to update the documentation and let you know it will no longer be maintained in place of Goose.

        Minor adjustment to the POD
        Added 'extends' for those of you who feel silly typing 'augment'. Myself included. Chances are if you need 'extends' you'll probably want Mo(o|u)se anyway ;-)

0.016   21/Nov/2011
        Updated the pod to reflect new chainable instructions, and added 'drop_sub' method.

0.015   21/Nov/2011
        Altered the 'chainable' method. Only return $self was getting a bit annoying when I actually wanted to bless something like $self-{_this}.
        Now you can add an extra parameter called 'bless'.
        # chainable 'method' => ( class => 'BlessTo::ThisClass', bless => '_this' );
        The above will return something similar to "return bless $self->{_this_}, 'BlessTo::ThisCLass'"
        If you ommit the 'bless' it will use just $self.

        I discovered a bug in 'augment' that was only allowing one augmentation. This has been fixed.


0.01    
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
