Revision history for Sub-Mage

I apologize for not updating this. From 0.14 I will try to remember :)

0.016   21/Nov/2011
        Updated the pod to reflect new chainable instructions, and added 'drop_sub' method.

0.015   21/Nov/2011
        Altered the 'chainable' method. Only return $self was getting a bit annoying when I actually wanted to bless something like $self-{_this}.
        Now you can add an extra parameter called 'bless'.
        # chainable 'method' => ( class => 'BlessTo::ThisClass', bless => '_this' );
        The above will return something similar to "return bless $self->{_this_}, 'BlessTo::ThisCLass'"
        If you ommit the 'bless' it will use just $self.

        I discovered a bug in 'augment' that was only allowing one augmentation. This has been fixed.


0.01    
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
